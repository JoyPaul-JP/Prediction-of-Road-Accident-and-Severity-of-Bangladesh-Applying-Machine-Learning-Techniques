# Prediction-of-Road-Accident-and-Severity-of-Bangladesh-Applying-Machine-Learning-Techniques
The project titled "Prediction of Road Accident and Severity of Bangladesh Applying Machine Learning Techniques" focuses on forecasting the occurrence and severity of road accidents in Bangladesh by analyzing 60 different factors across five types of casualties. Supervised machine learning models were employed using Euclidean distance-based targeting to enhance prediction accuracy. The system achieved exceptional performance with 99.77% accuracy for accident prediction, 99.80% accuracy for severity prediction, and F1 scores of 98.68% and 99.80% respectively. Implemented using Python, the project leveraged libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization. The solution provides valuable insights for road safety management.
